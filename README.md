# What should a man do for 10 marks? 
10 Marks; Marks, such an intanglible concept. I can't see those 10 Marks, 
I agree, I can see the final grades, I agree they fluctuate based on performance,
But these 10 marks, they're a very tiny chunk of this one subject,
on top of that, that subject is a chunk of one sememser, of the whole program,
Unreal amounts of labor for 10, while scribbling a rote-learned paragraph gets you hundred-folds!
Academia is very conventionally propagandistic in nature, with askewed and non-linear ways of achieving marks.
One should strip themselves of marking schemes and grades. 
It is one big controller of the mind, that has a cap on the qualitative, creative being.
